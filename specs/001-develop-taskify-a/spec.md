# Feature Specification: Create Taskify

**Feature Branch**: `001-develop-taskify-a`  
**Created**: September 5, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Develop Taskify, a team productivity platform. It should allow users to create projects, add team members, assign tasks, comment and move tasks between boards in Kanban style. In this initial phase for this feature, let's call it 'Create Taskify,' let's have multiple users but the users will be declared ahead of time, predefined. I want five users in two different categories, one product manager and four engineers. Let's create three different sample projects. Let's have the standard Kanban columns for the status of each task, such as 'To Do,' 'In Progress,' 'In Review,' and 'Done.' There will be no login for this application as this is just the very first testing thing to ensure that our basic features are set up. For each task in the UI for a task card, you should be able to change the current status of the task between the different columns in the Kanban work board. You should be able to leave an unlimited number of comments for a particular card. You should be able to, from that task card, assign one of the valid users. When you first launch Taskify, it's going to give you a list of the five users to pick from. There will be no password required. When you click on a user, you go into the main view, which displays the list of projects. When you click on a project, you open the Kanban board for that project. You're going to see the columns. You'll be able to drag and drop cards back and forth between different columns. You will see any cards that are assigned to you, the currently logged in user, in a different color from all the other ones, so you can quickly see yours. You can edit any comments that you make, but you can't edit comments that other people made. You can delete any comments that you made, but you can't delete comments anybody else made."


## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A predefined user (product manager or engineer) selects their identity, views available projects, selects a project, and manages tasks on a Kanban board. Tasks can be assigned, moved between columns, and commented on. Users see their assigned tasks highlighted.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the app is launched, **When** a user selects their name from the list, **Then** they see a list of projects.
2. **Given** a user is viewing a project, **When** they move a task card to a new column, **Then** the task's status updates accordingly.
3. **Given** a user is viewing a task card, **When** they add a comment, **Then** the comment appears under the task and can be edited or deleted by the author only.
4. **Given** a user is viewing the Kanban board, **When** a task is assigned to them, **Then** the card is visually distinguished from others.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if two users try to move the same task at the same time? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is real-time collaboration required?]
- How does the system handle very long comment threads?
- What if a user tries to assign a task to a non-existent user? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should this be prevented in the UI?]


## Requirements *(mandatory)*


### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow selection from five predefined users (1 product manager, 4 engineers) at launch.
- **FR-002**: System MUST display a list of three sample projects after user selection.
- **FR-003**: System MUST present a Kanban board for each project with columns: To Do, In Progress, In Review, Done.
- **FR-004**: Each sample project MUST have a variable number of tasks (between 5 and 15), with tasks randomly distributed among all Kanban states (To Do, In Progress, In Review, Done), and at least one task present in each state per project.
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to create, assign, and move tasks between columns.
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to add, edit, and delete their own comments on tasks.
- **FR-007**: System MUST prevent users from editing or deleting comments made by others.
- **FR-008**: System MUST visually distinguish tasks assigned to the current user.
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow assigning any predefined user to a task.
- **FR-010**: System MUST not require login or password for access.
- **FR-011**: System MUST support unlimited comments per task card.
- **FR-012**: System MUST prevent assignment of tasks to non-existent users.
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle simultaneous actions gracefully. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is real-time sync required or is last-write-wins sufficient?]

### Key Entities
- **User**: Represents a predefined participant (product manager or engineer). Attributes: name, role, unique ID.
- **Project**: Represents a collection of tasks. Attributes: name, unique ID, list of tasks.
- **Task**: Represents a work item. Attributes: title, description, status, assigned user, comments, unique ID.
- **Comment**: Represents a user comment on a task. Attributes: author (user), content, timestamp, editable/deletable by author only.
- **Kanban Board**: Represents the workflow for a project. Attributes: columns (To Do, In Progress, In Review, Done), list of tasks per column.
